    <p class="text-muted mb-0">
      Have questions about what kind of art you can/should submit? Here are some general guidelines.
    </p>
  </header>

  <!-- What counts as “art” -->
  <article class="form-card mb-3">
    <h5 class="mb-2">We take an expansive view of “the arts.”</h5>
    <p class="mb-3">
      We’re thinking broadly — visual arts, performing arts, literary arts, and more.
    </p>

    <p class="fw-semibold mb-2">Examples that fit well:</p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <ul class="mb-3">
          <li>Architecture</li>
          <li>Dance</li>
          <li>Fiction</li>
          <li>Film</li>
          <li>Music</li>
          <li>Painting</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <ul class="mb-0">
          <li>Photography</li>
          <li>Poetry</li>
          <li>Sculpture</li>
          <li>Television</li>
          <li>Theatre</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="mt-3">
      <p class="fw-semibold mb-2">Examples that are usually less suitable:</p>
      <ul class="mb-0">
        <li>News/opinion articles</li>
        <li>Most non-fiction books</li>
        <li>Memes</li>
        <li>Recipes</li>
        <li>Sports highlights</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </article>

  <!-- Obscurity / discoverability -->
  <article class="form-card mb-3">
    <h5 class="mb-2">Lean toward pieces slightly off the beaten path.</h5>
    <p class="mb-2">
      It’s great to love <em>Abbey Road</em>, <em>Game of Thrones</em>, or <em>Harry Potter</em> — but those works don’t need help spreading, and many recipients will already know them. Aim for something wonderful that a fair number of people might not know yet.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-0">
      That said, if you have a fascinating personal story about a well-known piece, share it! Seeing familiar work through your unique lens can be powerful.
    </p>
  </article>

  <!-- Linkability -->
  <article class="form-card mb-3">
    <h5 class="mb-2">Prefer pieces people can easily experience online.</h5>
    <p class="mb-2">
      If you’re torn between a novel that costs money/time and a song that’s freely available online, choose the song. The more accessible the piece, the better the sharing experience.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-0">
      But if you really want people to know about that novel — go for it.
    </p>
  </article>

  <!-- What to write -->
  <article class="form-card">
    <h5 class="mb-2">Be thoughtful about what you write.</h5>
    <p class="mb-0">
      No need for a five-paragraph essay, but everyone benefits when you share something personal and meaningful — why it matters to you, how you found it, what to notice, or the story behind your pick.
