<h6>Omnivore is an art-sharing platform. We start a new round every month: submit a piece of art that you love, and twice a week for the rest of the month, you'll get back a random artwork that someone else has shared.</h6>

<h5>To get involved:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Sign up for an account.</li>
  <li>Submit one piece of art here. Guidelines for submissions can be found on this page. For this round, we will start sharing art on July 5th - you can submit your chosen piece after that, but you'll only receive art if you've shared something!  </li>
  <li>Enjoy the art that others have shared! You'll receive a piece every Tuesday and Friday.</li>
</ul>

<p>Check out our FAQ page for more details, or email jonathan@omnivorearts.com with any other questions/feedback!</p>
